# Volatility Modeling and Simulation ðŸ“ˆ

This project explores and compares different methods of modeling stock volatility using Python. It combines **real market data**, **Black-Scholes implied volatility**, **historical moving average volatility**, and **Heston model simulations** to analyze the behavior and estimation of asset volatility.

## ðŸ“Š Features

- **Implied Volatility**: Extracted from option prices using the Black-Scholes formula.
- **Historical Volatility**: Computed via rolling standard deviation of log returns.
- **Heston Model Simulation**: Stochastic volatility simulated over multiple paths.
- **Visualization**: Uses Plotly to compare volatility estimates.
- **RMSE Evaluation**: Quantifies deviation between model and real volatility.
